# CarnivoreSuite CLAW

**CarnivoreSuite CLAW** is a pipeline for creating 2D assets and sprite sheets from 3D models. It takes animations from as many cameras/directions as you designate in your scene, renders an animation for each, organizes them into folders, and uses Montage to stitch them together into a sprite sheet. This tool is game-engine agnostic, perfect for generating 2.5D, multi-directional sprite-based characters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bruceki/CS_Claw.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    - **Blender** (with Python API enabled)
    - **ImageMagick** (Montage utility)

## How to Use

### Configuration
All of your configuration will take place here:
```python
output_base_path = '/your/output/folder/here/' # Where your files will be put
montage = '/opt/homebrew/bin/montage' # Change this to be wherever montage is. use which montage if you are on *nix

image_format = 'PNG'
image_extension = '.png'
image_width = 1920
image_height = 1080

sheet_name = 'spritesheet'
sprite_geom_W = 512 # Sprite cell width
sprite_geom_H = 512 # Sprite cell height
filter = 'Catrom' # Image filter type
background = 'transparent' # background for sprite sheet

num_columns = 6 # Number of columns in your sprite sheet

camera_list = [ # Ensure these all match the camera names in your scene
    'Front_Camera', 
    'FrontRight_Camera', 
    'Right_Camera', 
    'Back_Right', 
    'Back_Camera', 
    'Back_Left', 
    'Left_Camera', 
    'FrontLeft_Camera'
]
```


1. Set up the paths for output:
   Update the script with your desired output folder:
   ```python
   output_base_path = '/your/output/folder/here/'
   ```

2. Customize the camera list and sprite sheet parameters, the default config above will assume there are 8 cameras in your scene. (make sure these match the camera names in your scene):
   ```python
   camera_list = ['Camera1', 'Camera2', 'Camera3']
   num_columns = 6  # Adjust to your preference
   ```

3. Run the script:
   Use the Blender Python API to run the script inside your Blender project. You can copy + paste the contents of CS_Claw.py in the Python folder over into your scripts panel in Blender and save it for future use.
